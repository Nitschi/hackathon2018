This project was submitted to the Open Codes Hackathon 2018 after 28 hours (including the idea)

Hardware required: Arduino, load cell, an alcohol sensor, Android smartphone

The game:

Goal: gain the most points before your drink is empty
When it is your turn you:
1. Put your drink on the scale
2. Get a challenge like: "Drink 46 ml, but not more"
3. You try to drink as close to that amount as possible and put the drink back on the scale
4. The milliliter you drank are your points, except if you drink more, then you get 0 points. If that already happens the second time an alcohol test is performed. If this detects you are very drunk you are disqualified.
5. The next person drinks
